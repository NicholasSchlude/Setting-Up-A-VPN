<br> 1. The first thing I did for this lab is set up a VM in Microsoft Azure to create my machine. With this lab, I used a different region outside of the United States to simulate a realistic and practical use of a VPN. </br>

<br> 6. I connected the VPN to a Japanese server, and can see my new IP address on the Proton VPN dashboard.
